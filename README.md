## Installation

#### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependency graph without interfering with your `Xcode` project setup. `CI` integration through [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) is also available.

Install Carthage through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and perform the following commands:

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Once *Carthage* has been installed, you need to create a `Cartfile` which specifies your dependencies. Please consult the [artifacts](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md) documentation for in-depth information about `Cartfile`s and the other artifacts created by *Carthage*.

```sh
github "EricssonBroadcastServices/iOSClientPlayer"
```

Running `carthage update` will fetch your dependencies and place them in `/Carthage/Checkouts`. You either build the `.framework`s and drag them in your `Xcode` or attach the fetched projects to your `Xcode workspace`.

Finaly, make sure you add the `.framework`s to your targets *General -> Embedded Binaries* section.
