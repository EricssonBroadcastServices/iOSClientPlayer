## Enabling Airplay
To enable airplay the client application needs to add an *Airplay* button to the playback controls (pause, play, etc). This is done by adding an `MPVolumeView` with `setShowsVolumeSlider` to `NO`.

```Swift
let airplayButton = MPVolumeView()
airplayButton.showsVolumeSlider = false
view.addSubview(airplayButton)
```

#### Background Modes
Client applications who wish to continue *Airplay* once a user locks their screen or navigates from the app need to set the relevant `Capabilities` in their *Xcode* project.

1. Select the relevant `Target` for your app in your *Xcode* project
2. Under `Capabilities`, locate `Background Modes`
3. Make sure `Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture` is selected
